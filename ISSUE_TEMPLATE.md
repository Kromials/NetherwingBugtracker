**Description**:  Cancelling a qued ability such as raptor strike before it lands.  

**Current behaviour**: Even if you click the "escape" key to cancel it (it stops glowing on the cast bar) the next melee hit still lands with Raptor Strike as if it was not cancelled in the first place.  

**Expected behaviour**:  To the best of my research all abilities that buff your next melee hit such as Raptor Strike ought to be cancellable.

**Server Revision**:
